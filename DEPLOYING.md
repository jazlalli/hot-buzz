# Deploying Online Wednesday

See [Deploying Sandpit Labs Apps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OocT0IvWeYHx0l1tInoHe7ZBWvWrIRRYQzy566X8r94) for instructions for all Sandpit Labs apps.

## Additional Online Wednesday-specific instructions

ssh labs@online-wednesday.sandpitlab.com

Online Wednesday has two services, `ow_webapp` and `ow_bgworker` - see the bin directory.

ow_webapp runs on port 3030 so that's what you'll have to redirect to port 80.
